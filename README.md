The Odin Project

This is the final project of Foundations Course, building a fully functional calculator.

I have taken a lot of inspiration for the UI from the Apple-calculator that can be found on their phones and tablets, in an effort to
make something more recognisable and modern.

A lot of research have been put in to the CSS to make the UI more realistic, for example box-shadow with inset, hover- and push-actions etc.

Again, I'm proud!
